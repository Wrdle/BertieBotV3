# PLEASE NOTE
This is the old BertieBot project. BertieBot is no longer self hostable but instead is now hosted by myself and is accessible from https://bertiebot.access.ly. However not yet available for public use. 

# BertieBotV3
BertieBot V3 is the latest version of Bertie Bot project, with the main goal being a discord bot with a interactive web interface that allows the user to set bot settings, see chat logs and more. This project is still heavily in alpha stages and is very buggy.

# Currently being worked on

#Upcoming features

- Hopefully youtube integration?
- Yeah look I just wanna add tonnes of features....

# Setting up the Bot
Yeah this could take a while

# What have I learnt?
Oh my... The amount I have learnt is incredible. I'll have to find the time to write this because it is so much.....
